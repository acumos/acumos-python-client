Acumos Python Client User Guide
===============================


|Build Status|

``acumos`` is a client library that allows modelers to push their Python models
to the `Acumos platform <https://www.acumos.org/>`__.

Installation
============

You will need a Python 3.4+ environment in order to install ``acumos``.
You can use `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`__
(preferred) or `pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`__ to install and
manage Python environments.

If youâ€™re new to Python and need an IDE to start developing, we
recommend using `Spyder <https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder>`__ which
can easily be installed with Anaconda.

The ``acumos`` package can be installed with pip:

.. code:: bash

    pip install acumos


Protocol Buffers
----------------

The ``acumos`` package uses protocol buffers and **assumes you have
the protobuf compiler** ``protoc`` **installed**. Please visit the `protobuf
repository <https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/tag/v3.4.0>`__
and install the appropriate ``protoc`` for your operating system.
Installation is as easy as downloading a binary release and adding it to
your system ``$PATH``. This is a temporary requirement that will be
removed in a future version of ``acumos``.

**Anaconda Users**: You can easily install ``protoc`` from `an Anaconda
package <https://anaconda.org/anaconda/libprotobuf>`__ via:

.. code:: bash

    conda install -c anaconda libprotobuf
